Hello world will start off by describing a C program. First we need to talk about the include, the function declaration, printing and the return statement.

	-Include files.
		-Basically the same as Copy/Paste.
	-main function declaration
		-We're not going to get into functions much right now
			-Important to know what is returned is returned to the operating system
				-Example of such.
		-Parameters being handed in. (We'll talk about this later).
	-printing out a line
		-The newline at the end.
