CSCI 1105/INFX 1604  Assignment 1
=================================

Place all of your solutions in a file called a1.py.

To submit your assignment:  log into a Computer Science workstation and 
create a folder called py in your U: drive.  Place your assignment in this
folder by the due date.  If you are off campus, you can use WinSCP to connect
to fcsfile.cs.dal.ca (same login and password), and then create the directory
and copy over the file.  If you need assistance, please see the instructor or
the TA for help.

1) Develop a function fahrenheit_to_celsius that takes a single parameter,
  representing a temperature in Fahrenheit degrees, and returns the equivalent
  Celsius temperature.  Include appropriate documentation for your function.

2) A quadratic equation is one that has the form a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0, where
  a, b, and c are given, and you are asked to find the value of x.  It is
  possible for a quadratic equation to have two solutions, one solution, or
  no solutions at all.  For example, x^2 - 2*x + 1 = 0 (a = 1, b = -2, c = 1)
  has exactly one solution, x = 1, whereas x^2 - 5*x + 6 = 0 (a = 1, b = -5,
  c = 6) has two solutions:  x = 2 and x = 3.  We can tell how many solutions
  a quadratic equation has by examining the quantity b^2 - 4*a*c.  If this
  value is:
    * positive, then there are two solutions
    * negative, then there are no solutions
    * zero, then there is exactly one solution

  Develop a function called count_quadratic_solutions that takes three
  parameters, a, b, and c, corresponding to the a, b, and c in the quadratic
  equation given above.  Your function will return the number of solutions the
  equation corresponding to these values of a, b, and c, possesses.  Include
  appropriate documentation for your function.

3) Develop a function called is_leap_year that takes a year as a parameter
  and returns True if the given year is a leap year, and False if it is not.
  A year is a leap year if:

   * it is divisible by 4,
   * UNLESS it is divisible by 100 (if it's divisible by 100, then it's not a
     leap year),
   * UNLESS it is divisible by 400 (if it's divisible by 400, then it IS a 
     leap year).

  Include appropriate documentation for your function.
