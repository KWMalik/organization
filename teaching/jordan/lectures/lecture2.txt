Programming language must be straight forward for computers to understand; unlike English.

Exercise: Speaking in a way your computer will understand:
	Algorithm - A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, in a finite number of steps.

	- Given  a deck of cards, give an algorithm for finding the highest.
		Assumptions: Aces are high and suites don?t matter.
	
	Method #1:
	1. Encode ranks
	2. Sort cards (this assumes a sort program exists)
	3. Lay them out: Largest = last card

	Method #2
	1. Encode ranks
	2. Flip top two of your dealt hand
	3. Cycke through the cards, discarding the smaller of the current two cards flipped & replace with 	a new card from the hand
	4. At end, discard the smallest, leaving the largest.
	Optimize: Stop if you ever see an ace.

- Second algorithm is most efficient because you are only dealing with 2 cards at a time instead of your whole hand.

Python
1. As a calulator:

	Exercise a: calculate the value of ?2+3?
		>>>2+3
		5
	Exercise b: Calculate ?28/4
		>>>28/4
		7
	Exercise c: Calculate the area of a square, with side length = 5
		>>>5*5                  or                    >>>5**2
		25                                                  25
	Exercise d: Calculate the area of a square, with side length = 9
		>>>9*9                  or                    >>>9**2
		81			           81

*Now have had repetitive questions (area of a square).  Should find a way to do it more efficiently
	- Take that operation and give it a name
		-Build an abstraction
	- In this case:
		- Abstract the idea of finding areas of squares into something we can name and reuse.
			-Define a FUNCTION:
				>>>def area_of_sqaure(n)
					return n*n
	- Where ?n? represents the data to be input. Also, the cursor is idented because ?function bodies? 	are indented.
		- First line says, ?To find the area of a square with side length ?n?, do the following:?
		- second line says, ?The desired result is n*n.?
	- area_of_square is a function - the squaring operation packed up and given a name.

Example: Find the area of a sqaure with side length = 5.
		>>>area_of_square (5)
		25
